# Title
Mammogram Classification for Breast Cancer Detection

## Team members
Jianhang Chen (JianHangChen), Vishveswaran Jothi (Vishwaatpurdue)

## Goals
Using deep learning algorithm to detect breast cancer in mammogram image.
The algorithm will train on MIAS database:
    Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database:   
http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html, Shows a demonstration of uploading a picture and receiving diagnois.

## Challenges
1. Develop a CNN network to detect breast cancer with low training data.
2. Use the pretrained model of inception-v3 developed by google: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567
3. Use transfer learning concept to retrain the inception model to fit for the mammograms
4. Compare the results with other network such as VGG16, if time is avalible.
5. Deploy a cloud based application for the developed model.
6. Develop an auto preprocessing script to get region of interest from unclean data.

## Restrictions --optional--
In this project, we cooperate with one other professor, hence we are not able to offer open source code.
But instead, we could show the result in the report or have a demonstration of breast cancer detection application.
