# Title
Mammogram Classification for Breast Cancer Detection

## Team members
Jianhang Chen (JianHangChen), Vishveswaran Jothi (Vishwaatpurdue)

## Goals
Using deep learning algorithm to detect breast cancer.
The algorithm will train on MIAS database:
    Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database:   http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html
Show a demenstration of uploading a picture and receiving diagnois.

## Challenges
1. use the pretrained model of inception-v3 developed by google: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567
2. use trainsfer learning concept to retrain the inception model
3. compare with other network, e.g. VGG,if time is avalible.
4. develop an application with basic uploading and diagnosis function

## Restrictions --optional--
In this project, we cooperate with one professor. We are not able to offer open source code.
But instead, we could show the result in the report or have a demonstration of breast cancer detection application.
